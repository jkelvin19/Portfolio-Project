<p class="about">
    My name is James Kelvin and I work in, I am 26 and work in the NHS. 
    My reason for getting into programming is I want to have a career change.
    I have intangible traits that work in any working environment and believe development is a great career path for me. 
    I've been learning to code for nearly 4 months now, and things are really starting to click, which I am delighted about for obvious reasons.
